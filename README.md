## Why Reusability is important

Reusability is important because it is more common to have reusable components that are driven by data than having lots of hardcoded data displayed on a screen. It makes more sense for scalability and to plan for future development and data.

## Props

Props are a great way to be able to build these React components and use them dynamically and reuse components when needed through the use of data.

## Create Componenets from an Array of Data

I was able to get hands-on experience with handling data and being able to create components that will display that data using props in React. Although I was using a file with all the data being handled in the project, I learned that this job would more often be used by calling in data from an API.
